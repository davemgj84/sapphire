# What do we need to do for MVD/MVP - Sapphire Monkey Checklist:

- X Setup Database for dialogue, badges, user, summary etc.
- X Add logic that stops sprite (collision logic)
- X Navbar component
- X Logo/Home page button component
- X Start Game button component
- X Chracter Sprite artwork - animations for movement on map
- X Dialogue box component
- X Routes connecting all of this to the DB
- X "Select Character" component
- X "Select Character" Artwork
- X will need 4-5 instances with different collision and ghostEvent hulk sprite at each scene location
- X Integrating text "typewriter function" into dialogue
- X Scene component
- X Background art for each scene (5 total?)
- X Dialogue buttons - "Next", "Continue", "End" - user interaction with the dialogue box?
- X Background Music for each section in the game? Music for Start game, scenes, map, final ending?
- X badge component
- X nest badge progress components?
- X show badges page? Not sure how we want this to look
- X Game Over Page
- X Endings for if we have gems or do not have the gems (i think we just make this dialogue and get the MVD dialled in)
- X Scene puzzles - mini games for each scene (4 scenes with games?) 3/3 - almost there
- X FINE tune Bottom component -
- X End Summary/Credits scrolling?
- X Actual map we will use for Demo -More tweaking - change it up :) SAND TILES
- X Make a story intro page?

- x - in progress - Controls component (buttons that show what to use to control the player movement and dialogue? Arrow keys and space bar)
- x - in progress - Choose colour scheme - and fonts

- Button Artwork for in map interactions ("Spacebar" to enter scene?) - CHANGE TO MAKE IT COHESIVE - CONSISTENT ('SPACE', 'START', 'A', 'S', game buttons)
- Writing the dialogue/story for the game - character interactions
- Title page art (Quest for the Sapphire Monkey)
- Artwork for sapphire monkey (pixel art)?

## STRETCH

- do we make the badges update dynamically in the dropdown, depending what you have gotten as a user? or just leave it as a list?
- Popup for getting a badge?
- Music/sound for getting a badge? player feedback
- Login/Logout button logic
- Dynamic backgrounds?
- Bring characters into scenes?
- IMPROVE Background art for each scene
- summary adventure?
- Character dialogue comes from character you chose

## This is a lot to consider - and I am sure we will encounter more as we work - Let's make a plan and destroy this list! I believe in us!
