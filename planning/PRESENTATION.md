# HOW WE WORKED AS A TEAM

- We pair programmed a lot of the major challenges together
- We divided and conquered when possible
- We code reviewed every morning to get everyone on the same page
- We had meetings to show each other's work before merging
- This allowed us all to understand the codebase as a whole, while practicing our own skills
- When encountering problems we took them on as a team to work through them
- Available for each other when needed - great communication.
-

# FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

- More time to build out more paths - richer universe and lore - more adventures to choose from.
- Music/sound for getting a badge?
- Dynamic backgrounds - More background art that scrolls through within each scene
- Bring characters into scenes?
- Adventure Summary - we were implementing this feature - but still needs work.
- Character dialogue (dynamic dialogue) comes from character you choose.
- THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS!
